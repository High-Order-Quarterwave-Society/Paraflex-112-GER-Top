# Paraflex-112-GER-Top
Paraflex 112 German Top Cabinet Final design

The PF-112-GER-TOP was originaly designed by Matthew Morgan J. member of the **Higher Order Quarterwave Society** (HOQWS) which was started back in 2013 by Matthew Morgan J, Dustin Morgan (Flex Tech Designs) and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts) 

The PF-112-GER is based on a low and high tuned resonator (LTR/HTR) making the design very efficient in it's bandwidth, therefore the named **Paraflex** was chosen. Many prototypes and design revisions have been made by members of the HOQWS, continualy improving the design of the cabinet and its different versions resulted into this final revision.

Other designs using the Paraflex principles where made for subwoofers, kickbins and tops. There are always new concepts and designs in progress on the [HOQWS facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bassaz/). 

# Working range (NEED UPDATE)
The PF-112-mk1 has a XX (Fb) tuning and working range shall be XX to XX. With phase plugs on the mid driver baffle this can be extended to XXXhz. Recomended crossover setting depends on the drivers used, but a basic setting can be set with a XX order XX Highpass Filter (XXdB/LR HPF) and a XXhz XZdB/LR LP. However we encourage the user to adjust the frequency range and filter based on their application and measurements.

# Adding waveguides or horn to extend to 16-20Khz
The PF-112-mk1 can be fitted with a Line-array type waveguide or a exponential horn on top of the cabinet (or modeled into an extended cabinet). We recomend 1.4" or higher Compression Drivers capable in a range from about 800Hz, 900Hz or 1Khz up to 16-20Khz. 

# Notes
AWAITING NEW REVISION STATUS 2023.
